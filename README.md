# NEMO Container Repository

## Singularity

We support the following definition files for NEMO. We will try to add definitions for commonly used software on the cluster.

NEMO Singularity container files are available at https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/nemo and can be used on the cluster or as base for other container images.

## Contributing

You can fork this repo and add your own definition files. After a positive review the files will be merged to this repository.
